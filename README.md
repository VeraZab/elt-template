### SELF HOSTED PREFECT / BIG QUERY / COMPUTE ENGINE / DBT CORE / TERRAFORM EXPERIMENT

</br>
This is an experiment of how to self host Prefect Orion server on Google Compute Engine. There's no auth here, so not a complete real life example, more of an inspiration. I don't know of an easy(ish) way to setup auth for that server, would be happy to hear any feedback on this.

</br>
Both Prefect Orion and Prefect Agent are hosted here in the same VM with the help of tmux.

</br>
Also experimenting here with some basic CI/CD to build and apply a deployment.

</br>
Happy if it helps anyone get started. Feedback / Comments welcome!
